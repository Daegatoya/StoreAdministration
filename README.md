# StoreAdministration
So, yeah. Basically, it's an administration pannel that could be used by stores to manage the stocks of their items. It's a kind of simulation. Take it as a proof of activity from me

## Important

Obviously, in the class `DatabaseParent.cs`, you will need to change the connection string to put yours

So, change : 

```cs
connectionString = $"server=127.0.0.1;port=3306;uid=root;pwd={password.Replace(" ", "")};database=new db";
```

with : 

```cs
connectionString = $"server={Your Server};port={Your Port};uid={Your Username};pwd={password.Replace(" ", "")};database={Your Database Name}";
```
